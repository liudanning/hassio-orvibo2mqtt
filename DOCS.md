# Configuration
An additional top-level `config_path` option is required. Set this to the path where you would like the add-on to persist data. Defaults to `/config/orvibo2mqtt`. Note that both `config` and `share` directories are mapped into the container (read-write) and are available to you.

See the `/config/*.json` [Examples](https://github.com/liudanning/orvibo2mqtt/tree/master/config).

For more information see the [orvibo2mqtt](https://github.com/liudanning/orvibo2mqtt) and [orvibo-b25-server](https://github.com/sandysound/orvibo-b25-server).
